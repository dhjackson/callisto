  <h2>Callisto Overview</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    Most Learning Record Stores (LRSes) that support IMS Global Caliper (or XAPI)
    today just store the JSONB of the event payload in some fashion. There is no
    built-in query capability. You must write rather elaborate JSON queries to
    gain insight into student usage patterns based on the events.
    </p>
    <p>
    Callisto provides the same generic event store. But it decomposes the various
    event types into their own structured forms and then exposes specific REST
    queries for each event type. It is our hope that the Callisto query web Services
    eventually become extensions to the IMS Global Caliper standard.
    </p>
    <h2>Code and Architecture</h2>

    <p>Callisto is a very simple Ruby on Rails app with models and controllers for
    (eventually) all important Caliper events likely to be used for query. It is written
    for Postgres due to PG's excellent JSONB and fulltext support which are likely to be helpful.
    It could be ported to other relational databases. Given its focus on web service query,
    Callisto will stick very closely to the generated Rails scaffolding for the models for each Caliper event.
